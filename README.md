# AWS Cloud Practitioner - Short Notes 📘☁️

Welcome to the **AWS Cloud Practitioner Short Notes** repository!

This is a community-driven effort to simplify and summarize the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification topics. Each section is separated by folders based on the topics covered in the exam, and each folder contains a `README.md` file with short, focused notes on that topic.

---

## 📚 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a key topic area for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. Inside each folder, you'll find a `README.md` file that contains the summarized notes.

### Example Structure:
```
    📁 Introduction to Cloud Computing
    └── README.md

    📁 Introduction to EC2
    └── README.md

    📁 Introduction to EBS
    └── README.md

    📁 AWS Billing and Pricing

```
